LoLPings on desktop! 1.0 Version
  
Thank you for buying my app!!

----

These are the smart pings from League of Legends, except they are for your desktop enviroment and you can use them on your web browser or any another program/app.

The mouse movement do not interfere where are you clicking.

It works like always: alt + left click and move your mouse in any chosen direction.

There are five pings: The regular ping (tiny blue down-arrow), missing (?), on my way, danger (red !) and assist me (green flag).

Interactive tool for streamers! Also contains volumen control.

----

The program will be hidden in the toolbar, you can close it there. Be careful and do not open too many of them.
Click on the .exe just to open it one single time. You may need to press alt to get properly out of the app.
