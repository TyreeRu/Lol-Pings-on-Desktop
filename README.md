These are the smart pings from League of Legends, but they are for your desktop and you can use them in your web browser or any another programs/apps.

The mouse movement do not interfere where are you clicking.

It works like always: alt + left bottom and slide your mouse to any direction.

It only has five pings: The regular ping (tiny blue down-arrow), missing (?), on my way, danger (red !) and assist me (green flag).

Interactive tool for streamers! Also contains volumen control.

----

The program will be hidden in the toolbar, you can close it there. Be careful to not open to many of them!
Click on the .exe just to open it one time. You may need to press alt to got properly out.
